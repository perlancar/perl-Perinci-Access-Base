0.29     2013-08-22 (SHARYANTO)

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

         - Remove _init() to make new() dead-simple. Subclasses should override

         [ETC]

         - Add some more docs.


0.28     2012-08-10 (SHARYANTO)

         - First release, split to make Perinci dist empty (that dist was a
           growing mixed bag and caused headache in dependencies).
